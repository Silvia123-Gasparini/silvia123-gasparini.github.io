## About
I am a motivated and adaptable individual with a degree in Accounting and Finance. I recently gained valuable experience volunteering at Grace Nation Church, where I assisted with various tasks and contributed to the smooth running of activities. I also have previous experience working at Foster Refrigerator, where I ensured products were properly prepared for shipment. I enjoy learning new skills and am eager to grow in a professional environment. Iâ€™m especially interested in opportunities where I can apply my knowledge, develop further, and make a positive impact.
Hi, nice to meet you.
